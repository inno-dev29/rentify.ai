Designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the structure emerges from the landscape as if it were a natural formation, with walls of volcanic stone and soaring windows that frame the mountain vistas like living art.\\n\\nThe main living pavilion is oriented to capture both sunrise over the mountains and sunset over the desert floor. The polished concrete floors incorporate a passive solar heating system, while deep overhangs protect from the midday sun. The furnishings\\u2014low-slung leather, desert-toned textiles, and sculptural cacti\\u2014complement rather than compete with the dramatic surroundings.\\n\\nThe kitchen merges indoor and outdoor cooking with a pass-through window to the sheltered courtyard, which features a firepit, plunge pool, and outdoor shower fed by our private well. Indigenous plantings attract hummingbirds and provide natural screening for ultimate privacy.\\n\\nThe primary bedroom suite occupies its own wing, with a king-sized platform bed positioned to view the stars through retractable roof panels. The en-suite bathroom is a sensory haven with a sunken stone tub, dual rain showers, and a private garden atrium.\\n\\nWhat truly distinguishes this property is the attached observatory. Housing a research-grade 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and equipped with astrophotography capabilities, it offers unparalleled views of the night sky from this International Dark Sky location. Our property manager, an amateur astronomer, can arrange a private viewing session during your stay.\\n\\nDays can be spent exploring hiking trails accessible directly from the property, visiting nearby hot springs, or simply watching the desert light transform the landscape from our meditation deck. As night falls, the absence of light pollution reveals a celestial display rarely experienced in our modern world.\\n\\nThis is a place for reconnection\\u2014with nature, with silence, with the cosmos, and perhaps with yourself.

Custom-built by a renowned naval architect and a wabi-sabi design master, this floating home achieves perfect harmony between water, light, and space.\\n\\nThe 800-square-foot interior feels surprisingly spacious thanks to thoughtful design elements: retracting glass walls that open the living area to the surrounding deck, built-in furniture that eliminates visual clutter, and strategic skylights that track the sun's movement throughout the day. The materials palette is intentionally limited to cedar, paper, stone, and steel\\u2014all chosen to weather beautifully with time and elements.\\n\\nThe main living space transforms throughout the day: a meditation area in the morning as sunlight streams across the tatami flooring; a convenient workspace during the day with uninterrupted views inspiring creativity; and an intimate dining space in the evening, with the custom table rising from beneath the floor.\\n\\nThe sleeping quarters feature a traditional Japanese platform bed with organic cotton bedding and shoji screens that can divide the space for privacy or open it to harbor views. The bathroom incorporates a deep wooden soaking tub and a shower that appears to cascade directly into the water below through a cleverly designed glass floor.\\n\\nThe wraparound exterior deck doubles your living space in fair weather, with a covered area for enjoying the surroundings even during gentle rain. A small rowboat is tethered to the side, allowing you to explore the harbor or visit nearby restaurants accessible by water.\\n\\nThis isn't merely accommodation but an immersive experience in mindful living and finding luxury in simplicity. The gentle rocking of the water supports deep sleep, while watching the play of reflections on the ceiling creates a natural meditative state.

The polished concrete floors incorporate a passive solar heating system, while deep overhangs protect from the midday sun. The furnishings\\u2014low-slung leather, desert-toned textiles, and sculptural cacti\\u2014complement rather than compete with the dramatic surroundings.\\n\\nThe kitchen merges indoor and outdoor cooking with a pass-through window to the sheltered courtyard, which features a firepit, plunge pool, and outdoor shower fed by our private well. Indigenous plantings attract hummingbirds and provide natural screening for ultimate privacy.\\n\\nThe primary bedroom suite occupies its own wing, with a king-sized platform bed positioned to view the stars through retractable roof panels. The en-suite bathroom is a sensory haven with a sunken stone tub, dual rain showers, and a private garden atrium.\\n\\nWhat truly distinguishes this property is the attached observatory. Housing a research-grade 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and equipped with astrophotography capabilities, it offers unparalleled views of the night sky from this International Dark Sky location.

The polished concrete floors incorporate a passive solar heating system, while deep overhangs protect from the midday sun. The furnishings\\u2014low-slung leather, desert-toned textiles, and sculptural cacti\\u2014complement rather than compete with the dramatic surroundings.\\n\\nThe kitchen merges indoor and outdoor cooking with a pass-through window to the sheltered courtyard, which features a firepit, plunge pool, and outdoor shower fed by our private well. Indigenous plantings attract hummingbirds and provide natural screening for ultimate privacy.\\n\\nThe primary bedroom suite occupies its own wing, with a king-sized platform bed positioned to view the stars through retractable roof panels. The en-suite bathroom is a sensory haven with a sunken stone tub, dual rain showers, and a private garden atrium.\\n\\nWhat truly distinguishes this property is the attached observatory. Housing a research-grade 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and equipped with astrophotography capabilities, it offers unparalleled views of the night sky from this International Dark Sky location. Our property manager, an amateur astronomer, can arrange a private viewing session during your stay.\\n\\nDays can be spent exploring hiking trails accessible directly from the property, visiting nearby hot springs, or simply watching the desert light transform the landscape from our meditation deck. As night falls, the absence of light pollution reveals a celestial display rarely experienced in our modern world.\\n\\nThis is a place for reconnection\\u2014with nature, with silence, with the cosmos, and perhaps with yourself.
